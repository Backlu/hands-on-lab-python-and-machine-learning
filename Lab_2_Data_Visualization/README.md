# Lab 2 - Data Visualization

In this lab, we'll visualize the relationship between continuous and categorical variables with housing prices using the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries in Python. This will help us better understand the relationships between various features and housing prices, providing further insights in our analysis.

The notebook we want to open is [lab2_visualization.ipynb](lab2_visualization.ipynb).
